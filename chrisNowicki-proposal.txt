Project: getsomeburgers.com 
yes - I was able to get this domain!!

Description:
I am a huge fan of cheeseburgers.  So why not create a social website where people can rate and post pictures of the burgers they find and eat.

Stack: MERN

MVP: Login/Register, Update Profile (with ability to add a picture) that resizes for avatar, Post a Burger: Upload picture of burger,
edit restaurant where you ate the burger (using YELP or Google API), Rate the burger with stars, Short description of experience (character count limit), protected routes, data validations with shown errors.
Edit post, delete post.

Product Backlog: Add a friend who is on the site as well, see their burger feed, recommend a burger to a friend (share social media link?), search for rated burgers
based on users location or zip (really will show its power when there is a database of rated burgers).
